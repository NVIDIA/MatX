rapids_cpm_download
-------------------

.. versionadded:: v21.10.00

Does the downloading of the `CPM` module

.. code-block:: cmake

  rapids_cpm_download()

The CPM module will be downloaded based on the state of :cmake:variable:`CPM_SOURCE_CACHE` and
:cmake:variable:`ENV{CPM_SOURCE_CACHE}`.

.. note::
  Use `rapids_cpm_init` instead of this function, as this is an implementation detail
  required for proper cpm project exporting in build directories

  This function can't call other rapids-cmake functions, due to the
  restrictions of `write_dependencies.cmake`
