rapids_cuda_set_architectures
-------------------------------

.. versionadded:: v21.06.00

Sets up :cmake:variable:`CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` based on the requested mode

.. code-block:: cmake

  rapids_cuda_set_architectures( (NATIVE|ALL) )

Establishes what CUDA architectures that will be compiled for, overriding
any existing :cmake:variable:`CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` value.

This function should rarely be used, as :cmake:command:`rapids_cuda_init_architectures`
allows for the expected workflow of using :cmake:variable:`CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES`
when configuring a project. If for some reason your project can't use
:cmake:command:`rapids_cuda_init_architectures` than you can use :cmake:command:`rapids_cuda_set_architectures`
directly.

.. note::
  This is automatically called by :cmake:command:`rapids_cuda_init_architectures`

``NATIVE``:
  When passed NATIVE as the first parameter will compile for all
  GPU architectures present on the current machine. Requires that
  the CUDA language be enabled for the current CMake project.

``ALL``:
  When passed ALL will compile for all supported RAPIDS GPU architectures

Result Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  ``CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES`` will exist and set to the list of architectures
  that should be compiled for. Will overwrite any existing values.
