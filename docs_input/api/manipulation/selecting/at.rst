.. _at_func:

at
==

Selects a single value from an operator. Since `at` is a lazily-evaluated operator, it should be used
in situations where `operator()` cannot be used. For instance:

.. code-block:: cpp

    (a = b(5)).run();

The code above creates a race condition where `b(5)` is evaluated on the host before launch, but the value may
not be computed from a previous operation. Instead, the `at()` operator can be used to defer the load until 
the operation is launched:

.. code-block:: cpp

    (a = at(b, 5)).run();

.. doxygenfunction:: at(const Op op, Is... indices)
