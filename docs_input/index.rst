This site contains all documentation for MatX, including API docs, tutorials, 
and example code. 

MatX is a header-only C++17 library for viewing and manipulating data on a GPU 
with signal processing primitives. MatX strives to have a user-friendly API that
Python and MATLAB users could pick up quickly. To allow this, a compiler supporting
C++17 is a requirement and MatX will not build with anything older.
