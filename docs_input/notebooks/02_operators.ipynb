    "## Operators, Expressions, and Generators\n",
    "In this tutorial, we introduce the concept of operators and operator expressions. It is assumed that the user has already been through the [01_introduction](01_introduction.ipynb) tutorial or is already familiar with MatX tensor types. \n",
    "\n",
    "Operators in MatX are an abstract type that defines an operation that returns a value at a given index. This concept is intentionally vague, which makes it extremely powerful for representing different concepts. As an example, both a tensor type and the addition operator `+` are MatX operators. In the case of the tensor, it returns the value in memory at that location, but for the addition operator, it returns the sum of values at a given location from both the left and right hand sides. Most operators come in unary types for operating on a single input or a binary type for operating on two inputs. For example, the expression `A + B` uses the binary `AddOp` operator to lazily add two tensors or other operators together. Operators can be chained into a longer expression, such as `A + B + conj(C)` where `A`, `B`, and `C` are all tensors or operators, and `+` and `conj` are operators. Operator expressions are lazily evaluated, so none of the operations inside the expression occurs until the `run` method is called. This allows for cleaner code since smaller expression types can be built up into temporary variables and used as part of a larger expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operators are assigned to tensors using the overloaded operator `=` to indicate lazy assignment in the context of an operator expression. Calling `=` does not execute any work on the device. It creates a new data type that can be executed later using the executor method `run` (covered later). Other types of assignment operators are also available for use in operators (`<<=`, `&=`, etc), and can be used in a chain of assignments as with non-lazy operators (`A = B = C`). All operators rely on the same precedence rules as normal operators. Because operators rely heavily on C++ templates behind-the-scenes, it is important to use the `auto` keyword whenever an operator is created and not executed immediately since the type is very difficult to obtain. Even a small change to a statement can have a dramatic effect on the template types, so specifying them by hand is not feasible. A tensor is always needed for the output of an operator so that the operator can write the results into an existing memory location. The tensor rank and size of each dimension must match the expected dimensions of the expression output or an assertion will be raised. Input operators may be of mixed rank and sizes provided that the particular operation allows for it. In certain cases, values are allowed to be *broadcasted* during an operator. For example, when adding a 2D tensor to a 1D tensor, the 1D tensor would repeatedly be added across all rows of the 2D tensor. The broadcasting rules follow similar rules as MATLAB's, and a good summary can be found at: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/compatible-array-sizes-for-basic-operations.html.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last topic in this exercise will cover MatX generators. MatX generators are an operator that can dynamically generate data from a formula without storing the interim values. For example, the values an identity matrix or a Hamming window can both be generated on-the-fly only by knowing the index of the value. Generators typically only take a Shape as input since their output is generated without input data."

    "MatX uses PyBind and Plotly as a visualization backend of tensor views. Basic plots are supported, such as line, bar, scatter, and contour. Using the Hamming window data from the previous example, we can visualize what the window looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c++\n",
    "viz::line(B, \"Hamming Window\", \"Sample\", \"Amplitude\", \"hamming.html\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualizations in MatX are under the `matx::viz` nested namespace. The string parameters above give the plot a title, X axis name, and Y axis name, respectively. The last parameter is an optional filename to output the plot to. If the code was running natively in this notebook the plot would appear here, but since this is a compiled program, we output to a separate html file that you can open in your file tree. Note that since this is a standard Plotly plot, all the functionality such as zooming and panning are present."
