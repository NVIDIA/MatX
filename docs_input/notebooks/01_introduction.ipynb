    "## Introduction\n",
    "Welcome to NVIDIA's MatX training! In this course, you will learn how to use MatX, a modern C++ header-only library designed for generic matrix and n-dimensional array (tensor) operations. By borrowing heavily from both Python and MATLAB syntax, MatX is designed to provide native CUDA performance all behind a friendly and extensible API. Whereas other GPU-accelerated numerical computing libraries like [CuPy](https://cupy.dev/) and [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/) allow the Python developer to build GPU-centric applications, MatX extends this \"quick build, fast performance\" thesis to the C++ developer. Our ultimate goal is to encourage developer productivity and provide a quick on-ramp from prototype code to statically-typed production code."

    "## Training Structure\n",
    "This training contains a series of tutorials in increasing order of name that will guide you through basic and intermediate MatX features. Early tutorials are implemented using an in-line interpreter that allows you to run MatX code natively in the Jupyter cells. Later, more complex tutorials that are performance sensitive will require you to open source code in separate source files, and run it from the Jupyter notebook. As time permits, there is another notebook called `99_assignments.ipynb` that will give a series of problems to solve using MatX primitives. The assignments have verification code to make sure the answer is correct."

    "## Motivation\n",
    "Writing high-performance GPU code usually requires writing CUDA code directly and having at least a basic knowledge of the underlying hardware. Users not wanting to invest the time to learn this will typically use higher-level languages with CUDA bindings, such as MATLAB or Python. Using these high-level languages may cause interoperability with existing libraries and software more difficult. High-level languages can also cause a performance penalty for applications that require the lowest latency or highest throughput. \n",
    "\n",
    "MatX aims to provide syntax familiar to high-level languages with the performance and interoperability of C++. Most of the runtime costs are transferred into compile-time costs by using C++ templates, and kernels are auto-generated for most tensor and domain-specific functions. MatX does not require any CUDA or hardware knowledge; users can write algebraic expressions or use simple functions on tensor objects without every writing CUDA code."

    "## MatX Structure\n",
    "MatX is structured into two separate, but compatible, APIs: tensor and frontend. The tensor API provides a suite of mathematical operations for operating on MatX tensor types. These operations are evaluated at compile-time and can be combined into chained expressions to improve performance. The frontend APIs are simple interfaces into numerous existing CUDA libraries. These include cuFFT, cuBLAS, cuSolver, and more. A common tensor type can be passed seamlessly between the tensor and frontend APIs, and MatX uses the information from these operations to call the appropriate kernels or libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key concepts in MatX's design and usage is the disassociation of memory allocation from processing. We will cover this concept in depth during the training, but MatX optimizes primitive performance by discouraging operations that negatively impact performance, such as deep copies. When creating an application, the user creates views into memory regions that provide zero-cost abstractions of looking at the data differently in memory."

    "## Terminology\n",
    "The basic building block of all MatX operations is the tensor. Having the common tensor type for all operations provides a powerful tool for manipulating data, and more importantly, abstracts much of the complexity from the user. MatX treats tensors as multi-dimensional arrays as in both Python and MATLAB. Tensors have three main properties: rank, size, and type. The rank and type are specified at compile time, while the size can be specified at either runtime or compile-time. The rank describes how many dimensions the tensor has and can be anywhere from 0 (scalar) to N, where N is limited by the amount of memory in your system. The size of the tensor describes how many elements are in each dimension. Lastly, the type of the tensor is the type of data stored in the tensor. MatX supports all common data types supporting C++ arithmetic operators, and can be extended to user-defined types that provide the same overloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tensors**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Tensors (`tensor_t`) provide views of the underlying tensor data and optionally allocate memory. Tensors describe properties such as stride, size of each dimension, and provide basic accessor functions for retrieving the data in a view. Tensors can be created from other tensors when convenient, which allows a view into another tensor without copying any data. For example, a sliced view of a tensor (which we'll get to soon) can be used to generate two more tensors of both real and imaginary parts of a complex number. The term `view` is sometimes interchangeably used with the term `tensor` in MatX since all tensors are simply a view into underlying memory. The memory backing tensors is reference counted; the last tensor to be destroyed either explicitly or implicitly will free any non-user-managed data. Users also have the option of passing custom pointers and maintaining ownership of the pointers so that nothing is freed from MatX when the tensor goes out of scope.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- **Operators**\n",
    "\n",

    "Using this form of `slice` requires a template argument with the rank of the new slice. The second parameter to `slice` takes the starting index for each dimension, while the third takes the ending index. To include all values from the beginning on, a special sentinel of `matxEnd` can be used. Similarly, `matxDropDim` is used to indicate this dimension is the one being sliced (i.e. removed). In this case we are slicing the second column of the tensor and all rows, which produces a new 1D tensor containing only the second column of the original tensor. This is equivalent to `t2[:,1]` in Python. \n",
