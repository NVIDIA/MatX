    "## Introduction\n",
    "Welcome to NVIDIA's MatX training! In this course, you will learn how to use MatX, a modern C++ header-only library designed for generic matrix and n-dimensional array (tensor) operations. By borrowing heavily from both Python and MATLAB syntax, MatX is designed to provide native CUDA performance all behind a friendly and extensible API. Whereas other GPU-accelerated numerical computing libraries like [CuPy](https://cupy.dev/) and [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/) allow the Python developer to build GPU-centric applications, MatX extends this \"quick build, fast performance\" thesis to the C++ developer. Our ultimate goal is to encourage developer productivity and provide a quick on-ramp from prototype code to statically-typed production code."

    "## Training Structure\n",
    "This training contains a series of tutorials in increasing order of name that will guide you through basic and intermediate MatX features. Most tutorials will require you to open the source code, make a small change, and run it from the Jupyter notebook. As time permits, there is another notebook called `99_assignments.ipynb` that will give a series of problems to solve using MatX primitives. The assignments have verification code to make sure the answer is correct."

    "## Motivation\n",
    "Writing high-performance GPU code usually requires writing CUDA code directly and having at least a basic knowledge of the underlying hardware. Users not wanting to invest the time to learn this will typically use higher-level languages with CUDA bindings, such as MATLAB or Python. Using these high-level languages may cause interoperability with existing libraries and software more difficult. High-level languages can also cause a performance penalty for applications that require the lowest latency or highest throughput. \n",
    "\n",
    "MatX aims to provide syntax familiar to high-level languages with the performance and interoperability of C++. Most of the runtime costs are transferred into compile-time costs by using C++ templates, and kernels are auto-generated for most tensor and domain-specific functions. MatX does not require any CUDA or hardware knowledge; users can write algebraic expressions or use simple functions on tensor objects without every writing CUDA code."

    "## MatX Structure\n",
    "MatX is structured into two separate, but compatible, APIs: tensor and frontend. The tensor API provides a suite of mathematical operations for operating on MatX tensor types. These operations are evaluated at compile-time and can be combined into chained expressions to improve performance. The frontend APIs are simple interfaces into numerous existing CUDA libraries. These include cuFFT, cuBLAS, cuSolver, and more. A common tensor type can be passed seamlessly between the tensor and frontend APIs, and MatX uses the information from these operations to call the appropriate kernels or libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key concepts in MatX's design and usage is the disassociation of memory allocation from processing. We will cover this concept in depth during the training, but MatX optimizes primitive performance by discouraging operations that negatively impact performance, such as deep copies. When creating an application, the user creates views into memory regions that provide zero-cost abstractions of looking at the data differently in memory."

    "## Terminology\n",
    "The basic building block of all MatX operations is the tensor. Having the common tensor type for all operations provides a powerful tool for manipulating data, and more importantly, abstracts much of the complexity from the user. MatX treats tensors as multi-dimensional arrays as in both Python and MATLAB. Tensors have three main properties: rank, size, and type. The rank and type are specified at compile time, while the size can be specified at either runtime or compile-time. The rank describes how many dimensions the tensor has and can be anywhere from 0 (scalar) to N, where N is limited by the amount of memory in your system. The size of the tensor describes how many elements are in each dimension. Lastly, the type of the tensor is the type of data stored in the tensor. MatX supports all common data types supporting C++ arithmetic operators, and can be extended to user-defined types that provide the same overloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tensors**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Tensors (`tensor_t`) provide views of the underlying tensor data and optionally allocate memory. Tensors describe properties such as stride, size of each dimension, and provide basic accessor functions for retrieving the data in a view. Tensors can be created from other tensors when convenient, which allows a view into another tensor without copying any data. For example, a sliced view of a tensor (which we'll get to soon) can be used to generate two more tensors of both real and imaginary parts of a complex number. The term `view` is sometimes interchangeably used with the term `tensor` in MatX since all tensors are simply a view into underlying memory. The memory backing tensors is reference counted; the last tensor to be destroyed either explicitly or implicitly will free any non-user-managed data. Users also have the option of passing custom pointers and maintaining ownership of the pointers so that nothing is freed from MatX when the tensor goes out of scope.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- **Operators**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Operators are an abstract term used for types that can return a value at a given index. Currently there are three types of operators: tensors, operator expressions, and generators. Operators are covered in more detail in lesson 2."

One exception to this is when a user wants to use `tensor_t` as a class member variable. In that case you need to use `tensor_t` directly, and in the constructor of your class use `make_tensor` with your `tensor_t` variable as the first argument. This will be demonstrated later.\n",
    "\n",
    "`make_tensor` takes one template parameter indicating the type of the tensor, and zero or more function parameters. At a minimum, the sizes of the tensor are specified in curly braces, or in the case of a 0-D tensor, no size list is specified. For a complete guide on creating tensors in different ways, please visit: https://nvidia.github.io/MatX/creation.html.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the line above we are creating a 2D tensor (matrix) of integer values. These template parameter and size list are required for all tensor objects to allow compile-time optimizations.

The `0` parameter is the CUDA stream, and for this example, we're operating only with the default stream (0). By default, prefetching will instruct the CUDA runtime to prefetch all data visible to the current view. After this step completes, the initialized data is visible on both the host and device. Note that if the user is not using managed memory, `operator()` to set values is not available on the host, and instead the values should be copied from a host-side tensor. \n",
    "\n",

If a tensor is being printed, the data backing it can reside either on the host or device, and MatX will move it before printing if needed. With no arguments `print` will print the entire contents of the tensor. However, the size of the printing can also be limited by passing a limit to each dimension. For example, `print(3,2)` would print the first 2 columns and 3 rows of the 2D tensor. The contents of the tensor printed should appear as an increasing sequence of numbers from the top to bottom rows.\n",
