    "## Tensor Creation and Memory Backing\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensors are the base class of memory backed storage in MatX. The Tensor class is highly flexible with many options for memory types, residency, and ownership. By default, tensors are allocated using CUDA managed memory so that it's available on both the host and device. This is great for quick prototyping and development, but for production code it's recommended to use device memory or pinned host memory for performance reasons. A set of utility `make_tensor` functions are provided to help streamline and simplify tensor creation rather than declaring the tensor object directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "`make_tensor` takes one template parameter indicating the type of the tensor, and zero or more function parameters. Without any parameters the tensor is considered a \"null tensor\" and has no shape or memory backing it. This is useful when declaring a tensor that will be given a shape and allocation later. The sizes of the tensor are specified in curly braces, or in the case of a 0-D tensor, an empty set of braces. For a complete guide on creating tensors in different ways, please visit: https://nvidia.github.io/MatX/basics/creation.html.\n",

    "MatX provides several utilities for initializing and viewing its data inside tensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "To set a series of values explicitly the `SetVals` member function can be used by specifying values in an intializer list syntax. The initializer list uses nested braces to match the shape of the tensor and is supported up to 4D tensors. For higher ranks or very large tensors MatX provides an IO API to read in data from a file. See the [IO section](https://nvidia.github.io/MatX/api/io/index.html) for more information. `operator()` can also available to set and get individual values of a tensor as an alternative. `operator()` can both get and set individual values, but is not recommended for large tensors as setting individual values is not memory efficient. When setting values with both `SetVals` and `operator()` the memory backing the tensor must be modifiable from the host. For example, attempting to access device memory from these functions on a system without unified memory will result in undefined behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "`print` is a utility function to print a tensor or operator's contents to stdout. Printing can be used with any type of operator, including ones that have no memory backing them. With no arguments `print` will print the entire contents of the operator. The size of the printing can also be limited by passing a limit to each dimension. For example, `print(3,2)` would print the first 2 columns and 3 rows of the 2D tensor. Unlike `SetVals` and `operator()`, `print` can be used on tensors with memory not accessible from the host. In this case a copy will be performed to the host before printing."

    "## MatX Operators\n",
    "All of the examples above show how to view the operator's data differently, but no manipulation was done to the data. To manipulate the data, we use operators to define what work is to be done, and then call `run` to execute the operation (more on this later).\n",
    "\n",
    "Operators in MatX are an abstract type that follow the [operator interface](https://nvidia.github.io/MatX/basics/concepts.html#operator). The operator interface dictates a small number of methods that must be implemented to be used in MatX expressions. Everything from tensors to `operator+` are considered operators in MatX. Every operator in MatX except for tensors are lazy evaluated, meaning that the operation is not performed until the statement is executed. For example, the expression `C = A + B` will not perform the addition or assignment until the `run` function is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most operators come in unary types for operating on a single input or a binary type for operating on two inputs, but operators can be defined for an arbitrary number of inputs. Advanced users can also define their own operators. MatX supports most of the standard unary operators a user would expect from a library like NumPy. Broadcasting of operators is also supported, which allows for operations between tensors of different ranks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operator expressions follow the normal type promotion rules of C++ and any type errors or warnings will be reported at compile time.\n",
