/**
 * FFT Convolution
 *
 * This example shows how to perform an FFT convolution using the MatX library.
 * The example shows the convolution theorem of:
 *
 * \f(h*x \leftrightarrow H \cdot X$  \f)
 *
 * Namely, a convolution in the time domain is a point-wise multiplication in
 * the frequency domain. In this example we start with two signals in the time
 * domain, convert them to frequency domain, perform the multiply, then convert
 * them back to the time domain. This should give very close results to
 * performing a direct convolution in the time domain, so the results are
 * compared to a direct convolution. They will not match identically since the
 * types and order of operations are different, but they will match within a
 * close margin.
 *
 * FFT convolution is frequently used in signal processing when a signal or
 * filter is larger than a threshold, since it will outperform direct
 * convolution past this threshold. Another benefit of FFT convolution is the
 * number of operations is the same, regardless of the filter size. This allows
 * a user to FFT a very long filter one time, and that buffer can be used many
 * times for any incoming samples.
 *
 * For smaller signal sizes, the FFT convolution typically performs worse since
 * there is some buffer and 3 FFT operations (2 for FFT of signal and filter,
 * and 1 IFFT after the multiply) that causes the setup time to dominate.
 *
